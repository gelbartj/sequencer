# Sequencer

This simple web app generates random arithmetic sequences, then challenges the user to find the expression for the *n*th term of the sequence. It accepts answers of the form *dn + b* and *a0 + d(n-1)* and tracks how many answers in a row the user has gotten correct. 

Built with React + TypeScript. Hosted on firebase [here](https://sequencer-911f7.web.app/).
